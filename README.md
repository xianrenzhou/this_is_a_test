## Introduction

The Intelligent Cognitive Systems Laboratory (iCost) at BUPT (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications) is actively engaged in long-term research in multiple cutting-edge fields, including computer vision and embodied intelligence. Our research spans various sub-domains such as action recognition, human pose prediction and estimation, uncertainty research, multimodal and audio-visual learning, audio-visual event detection, medical image segmentation, 3D object detection, adversarial strategies, embodied navigation, and robot grasping.

Our research team has achieved substantial results, publishing numerous high-quality research papers in internationally recognized and authoritative journals such as IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (IEEE TIP), IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (IEEE TCSVT), and top-tier conferences like AAAI.

In the Intelligent Cognitive Systems Laboratory, we encourage communication and collaboration among team members, fostering a rigorous and harmonious academic atmosphere. We warmly welcome scholars, researchers, and students who are passionate about artificial intelligence and related fields to join us or collaborate. We believe that everyone with a curiosity for science can find their stage here.
